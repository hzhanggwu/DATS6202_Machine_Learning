# Welcome to DATS 6202 Machine Learning I

**Instructor: Huan Zhang (huan.zhang@gwu.edu)**

## Learing objective
In this course we will discuss the idea, practice and math of popular Machine Learning methods. While we will dive into the math behind some shallow and deep models, the real focus of
this course is to teach students how to use popular Machine Learning tools to solve real-word problems.
